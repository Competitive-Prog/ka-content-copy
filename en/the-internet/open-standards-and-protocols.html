You don't need to ask for permission to follow the protocols, you don't have to buy particular hardware to , and you don't need to pay money to the company that created the protocol. You simply need to read the standard and make sure the computing device follows that standard correctly.</div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3"><div class="paragraph">By contrast, some communication protocols are proprietary. As an example, Skype is a voice calling application which uses its own proprietary protocol to send and receive voice calls. The Skype protocol is not publicly described anywhere and the Skype application is closed-source. That makes it very hard for anyone besides Microsoft (the owner of Skype) to develop applications that can send or receive Skype calls.  <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><span></span><span><span></span><span aria-describedby="katex-uid--1-described-by-id" aria-hidden="true" style="white-space: nowrap;"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mrow></mrow><mn>1</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">^1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span id="katex-uid--1-described-by-id" style="border: 0px; clip: rect(0px, 0px, 0px, 0px); height: 1px; margin: -1px; overflow: hidden; padding: 0px; position: absolute; width: 1px;">start superscript, 1, end superscript</span></span><span></span></span></div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4"><div class="paragraph">The creators of the Internet made the protocols open on purpose.
