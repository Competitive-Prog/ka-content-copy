There is no bureaucratic process that blocks a device from joining or prevents a programmer from learning how the protocols work.</li><li>The IPv6 addressing system can uniquely address a <em>trillion trillion</em> times the amount of devices currently connected to the Internet.</li><li>Routing is dynamic, so new routers can join a network at any time and help to move data packets around the Internet.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><div class="paragraph">The Internet was designed to be scalable, but no system is infinitely scalable. </div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">What threatens the scalability of the Internet? 
Or put another way, what could go wrong if every single device in the world connected to the Internet right now and attempted to download a movie? </div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2"><div class="paragraph">Here are a few ideas:</div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3"><ul><li>Network connections have limited bandwidth. A huge amount of data may flow easily through the very high bandwidth connections but it could easily overwhelm low bandwidth connections, leading to delays or dropped packets.</li><li>Routers have limited throughput (the amount of data they can forward per second). A modern consumer router has a throughput around 1 Gbps while much more expensive enterprise routers can forward up to 10 Gbps. An average movie is around 1 to 10 GB, so a worldwide download-a-thon could get bottlenecked in the routers.</li><li>Wireless routers often have a limitation in the number of devices that can be connected to them, typically up to 250 devices. If everyone tried to use a shared WiFi network at the same time (like in a university or library), they might find themselves simply unable to join.</li></ul></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4"><div class="paragraph">🤔 Based on everything you've learned about the Internet, what else might affect its scalability, for good or for bad?  <div class="perseus-widget-container widget-nohighlight widget-inline"><div class="_167wsvl"><div class="_pupwzyp"><a aria-expanded="false" class="_13sgcdp7 _7n4oib" href="javascript:void(0)" role="button" tabindex="0">[Discuss]</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><h2>Web application scalability</h2></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">A web application that runs on top of the Internet must also be scalable, whether it's an iPhone app, a website, or multiplayer game.
