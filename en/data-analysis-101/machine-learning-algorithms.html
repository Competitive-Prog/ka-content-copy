The algorithm gains experience by processing more and more data and then modifying itself based on the properties of the data.</div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><h2>Types of machine learning</h2></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">There are many varieties of machine learning techniques, but here are three general approaches:</div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2"><ul><li><strong>reinforcement learning</strong>: The algorithm performs actions that will be rewarded the most. Often used by game-playing AI or navigational robots.</li><li><strong>unsupervised machine learning</strong>: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data by clustering and identifying similarities. Popular uses include recommendation systems and targeted advertising.</li><li><strong>supervised machine learning</strong>: The algorithm analyzes labeled data and learns how to map input data to an output label. Often used for classification and prediction.</li></ul></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3"><div class="paragraph">Let's dive into one of the most common approaches to understand more about how a machine learning algorithm works.</div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><h2>Neural networks</h2></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">An increasingly popular approach to supervised machine learning is the <strong>neural network</strong>.
