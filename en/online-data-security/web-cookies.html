Websites often use <strong>cookies</strong> to track user actions on their site and even across other sites.  </div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">Websites track user history in order to improve their services. As both users and creators of software, it's important for us to understand how they track that data and how much control users have over that tracking.</div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><h2>What's a cookie?</h2></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">An <strong>HTTP cookie</strong> is a small amount of text that helps a website track information about a user across multiple pages of the website and personalize the user's experience on the website. If you've ever logged into a website, a cookie kept you logged in across multiple pages. </div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><h2>The cookie process</h2></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">Let's walk through how a cookie is actually set. <em>(If you're feeling fuzzy on the HTTP protocol, this is a good time to review <a class="_8gcxk83" href="/a/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0" target="_blank">HTTP &amp; HTML</a>.)</em></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><h3>Step 1: Browser requests a website</h3></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">Imagine a user that navigates to a website for the first time--or at least, the first time from that particular browser. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server that hosts the website.</div></div><div class="paragraph perseus-paragraph-centered" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2"><pre><code>GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.shoopshop.com</code></pre></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><h3>Step 2: Server sends cookie with response</h3></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">The server sends back an HTTP response and includes a <code>Set-Cookie</code> header in that response.</div></div><div class="paragraph perseus-paragraph-centered" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2"><pre><code>HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-type: text/html
Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
...</code></pre></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3"><div class="paragraph">The cookie contains a name (<code>sessionId</code>) and a value (<code>abc123</code>), plus an expiration date for the browser to clear this cookie from its memory.</div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4"><div class="paragraph">If it wants to set multiple cookies, it adds more <code>Set-Cookie</code> headers to the response.</div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><h3>Step 3: Browser stores cookie</h3></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">The browser saves the cookie information, storing it on the user's hard drive. That way, the data will persist even after restarting the browser or computer. That's why this type of cookie is called a "persistent cookie".</div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2"><div class="paragraph">There are also "session cookies", cookies with no expiration date which are always deleted when the browser is shut down.</div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><h3>Step 4: Browser sends cookies with requests</h3></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">When the user navigates to a different page on the website, the browser sends along the stored cookies with each HTTP request.</div></div><div class="paragraph perseus-paragraph-centered" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2"><pre><code>GET /shop.html HTTP/1.1
Cookie: sessionId=abc123</code></pre></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><h3>Step 5: Server personalizes response</h3></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">When the server receives the HTTP request, it inspects the cookies and sees that this request is coming from a user with a known <code>sessionId</code>. It can then look up that session ID in its database and use any information about the session to personalize the response.</div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><h2>Use cases for cookies</h2></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">There are many ways a website can use cookies to personalize an experience. A search engine can use them to remember how many results a user prefers seeing per page. A news site can use them to recommend headlines that are similar to the articles you've already read. All sorts of websites can use cookies to track analytics, like how long you spent on a page and which buttons you clicked.</div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2"><div class="paragraph">Any website with a log-in uses a cookie to keep you logged in on every page of the site. When you log out of that site, it clears the cookie and doesn't set it again until you login again.</div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3"><div class="paragraph">üîç You can see for yourself what cookies are being sent from a browser to a website by following the steps in this <a class="_8gcxk83" href="https://www.wikihow.com/View-Cookies" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0" target="_blank">wikiHow tutorial</a>. </div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4"><div class="paragraph">Here's a screenshot of a handful of the cookies used by Khan Academy:</div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="5"><div class="paragraph"><div class="perseus-widget-container widget-nohighlight widget-block"><div class="perseus-image-widget"><div class="fixed-to-responsive zoomable svg-image" style="max-width: 2880px; max-height: 590px;"><img alt='Screenshot of Chrome developer tools on a Khan Academy page.

When you visit a website and its server sends back an HTTP response with a cookie, the browser associates that cookie with the domain of the server. That's called a <strong>first-party cookie</strong>.</div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2"><div class="paragraph">However, a website can also include resources from other domains, like an image, iframe, or script. When the browser requests those resources, their servers can also send back cookies, which will now be associated with their domain. These are called <strong>third-party cookies</strong>.</div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3"><div class="paragraph">A 2016 study found that the average website loaded in about 20 third-party cookies, and the average news site loaded double that amount. </div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4"><div class="paragraph">What are they doing with all those cookies? Most third-party cookies are used for advertising. Imagine a user that visits a food blog with a recipe for gluten-free cookies. That blog includes a Facebook ad with a cookie. The user then visits facebook.com and notices a sudden uptick in ads about gluten-free products. That's not a coincidence, that's cookies!</div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="5"><div class="paragraph">Since third-party cookies serve a very different purpose than first-party cookies and infringe more on the privacy of web users, browsers have made it possible to disable third-party cookies entirely.
