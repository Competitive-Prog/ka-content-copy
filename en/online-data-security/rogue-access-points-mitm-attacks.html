When I visited the coffee shop a few weeks later, I saw a flyer warning customers that “Coffee Shop Wifi” was a <strong>rogue access point</strong>.</div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><div class="paragraph">What’s a rogue access point? To answer this, let’s first describe how a typical home gets Internet access.  </div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><h2>Access points</h2></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">Homes often connect to the Internet via a wired connection. Imagine that you couldn’t place a wire in your computer’s room. How else would you connect it to the Internet? You can use an access point. </div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2"><div class="paragraph">Access points connect to the Internet via a wired connection but share it wirelessly with many devices like your computer. You can think of access points as translators between the languages of wireless and wired signals. </div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3"><div class="paragraph">If you’re wondering why you’ve never heard of access points but have heard of routers, it’s because most routers include access points. Routers are responsible for transporting packets, not for providing wireless Internet access. </div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4"><div class="paragraph">You can see what an access point looks like below. Notice the Ethernet cable in the back that connects it to the Internet and the two antennae that broadcast and receive wireless signals.</div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="5"><div class="paragraph"><div class="perseus-widget-container widget-nohighlight widget-block"><div class="perseus-image-widget"><div class="fixed-to-responsive zoomable svg-image" style="max-width: 2048px; max-height: 1536px;"><img alt="Photo of a Linksys wireless access point." aria-hidden="true" src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/b9bfdf229551d750c096222b5688453121fa40b8.jpg" tabindex="0"/></div><span class="perseus-sr-only"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><div class="paragraph">Photo of a Linksys wireless access point.</div></div></div></span><div class="perseus-image-caption"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><div class="paragraph"><em>Image source: <a class="_8gcxk83" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Linksys_WAP54G.JPG" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0" target="_blank">Macic7</a></em></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><h2>Rogue access points</h2></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">A rogue access point is an access point installed on a network without the network owner’s permission. Why is this bad?</div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2"><div class="paragraph">If an attacker owns the access point, they can intercept the data (e.g. PII) flowing through the network. This is why the coffee shop provided the warning to its customers; they wanted to stop an unauthorized access point on their network from intercepting users’ data.</div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3"><div class="paragraph">Let’s now dive deeper into two ways rogue access points can intercept PII. </div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><h2>Passive interception</h2></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">In passive interception, a rogue access point can read your data but cannot manipulate it. If you connect to a network with a rogue access point and enter your password on a site over HTTP,  the rogue access point can read your password. </div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2"><div class="paragraph"><div class="perseus-widget-container widget-nohighlight widget-block"><div class="perseus-image-widget"><div class="fixed-to-responsive svg-image" style="max-width: 648px; max-height: 394px;"><img alt="Illustration of passive interception over a rogue access point.

By monitoring DNS requests and other Internet traffic, the rogue access point can profile your Internet behavior. This profile can expose private information about you such as the types of websites you visit.</div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><h2>Active interception</h2></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">In active interception, a rogue access point can also manipulate your data. They can read the incoming user data, modify the data however they want, and send the modified user data to the destination endpoint.</div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2"><div class="paragraph">For example, if a user visits a banking website and tries to deposit money into an account, a rogue access point can redirect the deposit to an attacker’s account.  </div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3"><div class="paragraph"><div class="perseus-widget-container widget-nohighlight widget-block"><div class="perseus-image-widget"><div class="fixed-to-responsive svg-image" style="max-width: 648px; max-height: 394px;"><img alt="Illustration of active interception over a rogue access point.

If we see something odd, we should notify the network owner. </div></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2"><div class="paragraph">We can also protect ourselves by using VPNs (virtual private networks) or <a class="_8gcxk83" href="/a/http-secure-https" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0" target="_blank">HTTPS</a>. VPNs and HTTPS both send a scrambled form of our data across the network. Even if rogue access points intercept it, they won’t be able to unscramble it.</div></div></div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="perseus-renderer perseus-renderer-responsive"><div class="paragraph perseus-paragraph-centered" data-perseus-paragraph-index="0"><hr/></div><div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><div class="paragraph">🙋🏽🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏿‍♂️Do you have any questions about this topic?
